## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB

InterventionDB is built with MVC architecture to enable changes to components as new features are added and to ensure the project remains maintainable as the user base grows. Key project requirements include ease of use, data security, and maintainability over multiple school years.

Registered users can add, edit, and delete student intervention data. Intervention data is linked to user-entered interventions and user-created student IDs. Collected intervention data includes student ID, date of delivery, teacher notes, and any assessment data.

User authentication is handled by Passport middleware. Templating via EJS and CSS via Materialize.
